But Unicode can be abstruse, and diving into the thousand-page Unicode Standard plus its dozens of supplementary annexes, reports, and notes can be more than a little intimidating. I don’t blame programmers for still finding the whole thing mysterious, even 30 years after Unicode’s inception.\"\n",

        "\n",
        "One key thing to keep in mind while thinking about Unicode and UTF-8 is that Unicode just defines a character to integer mapping. It does not define any specific binary representation for the character.\n",
        "\n",
        "UTF-8 on the other hand takes the mapping provided by Unicode and provides a binary representation for it. If all the unicode characters are to be represented using a naive way, then what's going to happen is that for each character you would need about 32 bits, which is extremely wasteful.\n",
        "\n",
        "So what UTF-8 does is that it specifies a variable length encoding. Each character is represented as a *stream* of bytes. But you would also need a way to specify the starting point, number of bytes, etc. for each character that you are encoding.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "If the character is ASCII ( has integer 0 to 127 ), the UTF-8 representation of it starts as: ```0yyyzzzz```\n",
        "\n",
        "For other characters, what UTF-8 does is that the first byte specifies how many bytes are there in the sequence. This first byte is part of that.\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, consider the following UTF-8 encoding.\n",
        "\n",
        "```\n",
        "1110xxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Here, the initial byte has 3 ones followed by a zero. That means that for this character, there are 3 bytes in total. `x` is the actual binary representation, and `10` in the subsequent bytes represents the *continuation*.\n",
        "\n",
        "UTF-8 uses 8-bit values in its encoding. There are 16-bit, 32-bit versions also but they are not used due to compatibility issues.\n",
        "\n",
        "UTF-8 uses the following rules:\n",
        "\n",
        "- If the code point is < 128, it's represented by the corresponding byte value. That is, it will be returned as a single byte object, and not as a list / sequence of bytes.\n",
        "\n",
        "- If the code point is >= 128, it's turned into a sequence of two, three, or four bytes, where each byte of the sequence is between 128 and 255. That is, to extract the sequence, you will need lists.\n",
        "\n",
        "Think about what this means, though. Because you have specified this particular format, there are going to be some numbers as per UTF that cannot be converted to any character. For example, take the number `10000000`. This is one byte and it doesn't start with a 0. So UTF-8 doesn't have a way of decoding this number!\n",
        "\n",
        "So what should it do? In Python, the `encode` and `decode` functions take an optional error parameter. If the number cannot be decoded, then we can replace that particular number with a `�`.\n",
